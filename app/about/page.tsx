            <p className="text-gray-600 mb-4">
              CVGPraySing was born from a deep passion for music and a calling to serve through song. With over a decade
              of experience in gospel music, composition, and teaching, our founder has dedicated their life to
              nurturing musical talent in individuals and communities.
            </p>
            <p className="text-gray-600 mb-4">
              The journey began in childhood, surrounded by the rich sounds of church music and family harmonies. This
              early exposure to the power of music in worship and community building shaped a lifelong commitment to
              musical excellence and spiritual expression.
            </p>
            <p className="text-gray-600">
              Today, CVGPraySing continues this legacy by providing comprehensive music education, creating original
              compositions, and helping others discover their own musical gifts.

        <div className="max-w-4xl mx-auto">
          <p className="text-gray-600 mb-6 text-lg">
            The name "CVGPraySing" reflects our core belief that music is a form of prayer and praise. Each note, each
            harmony, each carefully crafted composition is an offering of gratitude and a celebration of the divine gift
            of music.
          </p>
          <p className="text-gray-600 mb-6 text-lg">
            Our inspiration comes from witnessing the transformative power of music in people's lives. We've seen shy
            children find their voice, adults discover hidden talents, and communities come together in harmony. These
            moments fuel our passion and drive our commitment to musical excellence.
          </p>
          <p className="text-gray-600 text-lg">
            Through CVGPraySing, we aim to continue this tradition of musical ministry, helping others discover not just
            how to make music, but how to make music that matters â€“ music that heals, inspires, and brings glory to the
            Creator of all beautiful sounds.
